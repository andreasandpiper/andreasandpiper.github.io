### About the Project
> The idea stemmed from the need for a more attractive and easy to use website to display my crafts. I was previously using Wordpress and felt I did not need all the added features and struggled finding a template I liked. Liquid rendering easily loops through a list of images and created DOM objects on the page. A future goal for this website is to incorporate ecommerce.
