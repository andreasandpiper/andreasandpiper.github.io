      Andrea has been sewing since her teens and began birding while living in Springville, CA. After looking for bird gear,
      she noticed how difficult it was to find "real" birds on apparel. So The Hawk and Heron began in 2016, when Andrea 
      created her first bird hat, the mockingbird, as a gift to her husband.
      After receiving many compliments, she began making more designs, such as the kingfisher and quail. Over the years, 
      different people have requested new birds, broadening the diversity of the patches.
